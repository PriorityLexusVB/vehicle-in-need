# CodeQL Security Analysis Workflow
#
# IMPORTANT: This is an "advanced" CodeQL configuration.
# You MUST disable the "Default setup" in GitHub Settings for this to work:
#   Settings → Code security and analysis → Code scanning → Switch to advanced
#
# Using both default setup AND this workflow will cause errors:
#   "CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled."
