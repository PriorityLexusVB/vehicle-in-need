# Branch Health Report

This document provides an overview of the repository's branch health, identifying branches that are ready for merge, work-in-progress branches, and stale/diverged branches that should be considered for cleanup.

## Summary

| Category | Count | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ready for Merge | 2 | Review and merge |
| WIP/Draft | 2 | Continue work or close |
| Stale/Diverged | 13 | Recommend cleanup |

## Ready for Merge (Tests Clean)

These branches have passing tests and are ready for review and merge:

| Branch | PR | Tests | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/functions/functions-security-d0f6e8601e` | [#184](https://github.com/PriorityLexusVB/vehicle-in-need/pull/184) | 149 pass | Security update: jws 4.0.0 → 4.0.1 |
| `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/root-security-d0f6e8601e` | [#185](https://github.com/PriorityLexusVB/vehicle-in-need/pull/185) | 140 pass | Security update: jws 4.0.0 → 4.0.1 |

**Security Advisory:** Both PRs fix [GHSA-869p-cjfg-cm3x](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-869p-cjfg-cm3x) - a vulnerability in the `jws` package where `createSign` and `createVerify` did not require a non-empty secret when using HMAC algorithms.

### Recommended Action

Merge both dependabot PRs to address the security vulnerability:

1. Review PR #184 (functions directory jws update)
2. Review PR #185 (root directory jws update)
3. Merge after CI passes

## Skipped (WIP/Draft)

These branches are work-in-progress and were skipped from the merge-ready assessment:

| Branch | PR | Title | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `copilot/fix-manager-toggle-functionality` | [#183](https://github.com/PriorityLexusVB/vehicle-in-need/pull/183) | Improve error handling for Cloud Functions connection failures | In Review |
| `copilot/update-collapsed-order-card` | [#182](https://github.com/PriorityLexusVB/vehicle-in-need/pull/182) | Add summary row to collapsed order cards for at-a-glance details | In Review |

### Recommended Action

Continue development or merge when ready. No cleanup needed.

## Stale/Diverged Branches

The following 13 branches are 1 commit behind `main` but show 100+ commits "ahead" — this typically indicates:

- Work that was superseded by other changes
- Branches created from an older state of main
- Experimental work that was abandoned

### Recommended Action

**Clean up stale branches** to reduce repository clutter:

```bash
# Delete stale branches (run from repository root)
# Note: Review each branch before deletion to confirm it's no longer needed

# Fix-related branches
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-ci-failures-docs-ci-md
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-docs-ci-md-lint
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-markdown-lint-errors-ci-docs
git push origin --delete copilot/fixdocs-ci-md-lint

# Harden-related branches
git push origin --delete copilot/harden-auth-validation-workflow
git push origin --delete copilot/harden-auth-validation-workflow-again
git push origin --delete copilot/harden-gcp-auth-validation
git push origin --delete copilot/harden-gcp-auth-validation-again

# Firestore rules branches
git push origin --delete copilot/merge-paste-firestore-rules
git push origin --delete copilot/paste-firestore-rules-files

# Sub-PR branches
git push origin --delete copilot/sub-pr-165
git push origin --delete copilot/sub-pr-166
